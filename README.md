# movie-metadata-service

### Introduction
The Movie API is a Spring Boot application that can be used to search for movies and add new movies to a MongoDB. Users can put in HTTP requests for the data they want and can get all the movies but also can search for specific movies by both year and title. Users can send a body of data through the client (POSTMAN) to create a new movie. The client should return a HTTP response and any data associated with the HTTP request.
